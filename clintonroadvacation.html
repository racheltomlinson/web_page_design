	<h1>The Most Haunted Road in America</h1>
	
<!--It's been called the most haunted road in America, but there are probably other roads
			almost as haunted as this one.--!>

	<p>Looking for a place to toss a coin into a lake <br /> 
	and have a ghost boy toss it back? Or how about a Druidic <br /> 
	temple which allegedly houses witches and Satan-worshippers? Or maybe <br/>
	you're looking for Wiccan writings on the ruins of an abandoned castle along the road. <br />
	 If you answered yes to any of these questions, come visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Road_(New_Jersey)">Clinton Road,</a>

		<p> <q>I came by one night with my old pal, Jimmy. It was a full moon on Friday the 13, <br />
		which should've been our first red flag. We started hearing some weird chanting <br />
		coming from this moss-covered stone structure (shown above). Red flag number two. We <br />
		peeked around the corner to see about 13 witches sitting in a circle around what looked <br />
		 to be an old spell book. Let's just say Jimmy and I won't be stopping by any time soon.</q> - anonymous</p>

	<h2>  <u>Clinton Road's "Ghost Boy Bridge" </u> </h2>


<!--This part actually scares me-->

		<h4> "Ghost Boy Bridge" is one of the attractions that Clinton Road is most known for. <br />
		Legend has it that a little boy saw a shiny quarter in a nearby lake under a bridge near <br />
		Clinton Road. When he reached down to get it, he lost his balance and fell in the water. <br />
		Now, if you dare to toss a coin in the water beneath the ghost boy's bridge, he'll toss <br />
		it back to you. </h4> </figcaption> 

</figure>
		
		<p> <q>Now I'm a big fan of folk tales and legends and I'm not usually scared by them, <br />
		but this summer when I went to check out the "Ghost Boy Bridge" at Clinton Road, I nearly <br />
		had a heart attack just twenty minutes in. It's safe to say that those were the first and <br />
		twenty minutes I'd ever spend anywhere near Clinton Road. I had heard the legend about the <br />
		little ghost boy and the coins, so I thought I'd toss one in the lake just for kicks. Biiiiiig <br />
		mistake. At first, nothing seemed to happen. I wasn't pelted with dimes or anything, so <br />
		I decided to leave after fifteen minutes of waiting. When I was walking back to my car, <br />
		I heard a little "sploosh." I whipped my head around to see what it was and sure enough, my <br />
		dime that I had thrown into the lake had been tossed back at me. Turns out Ghost Boy has bad aim. </q> -Suzy Tens </p>
