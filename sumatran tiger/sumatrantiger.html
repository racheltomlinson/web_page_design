	      	<h2>  What is a Sumatran Tiger? </h2>
	       
	       		<p> Sumatran tigers are a subspecies of tigers. They are actually the smallest surviving 
	       		tiger subspecies, with a population of as little as 400. Sumatran tigers are roughly the 
	       		size of big leopards and jaguars. Their habitat ranges from lowland forests to mountain 
	       		forests and includes evergreen, swamp, and tropical rain forests. These environments are
	       		usually found in isolated areas in Sumatra. In the more recent news, two critically 
	       		endangered but healthy Sumatran tiger cubs were born on November 20, 2017, at the
	       		Jacksonville Zoo. <p>

	    		<!--why they are endangered and conservation efforts-->
	    		
	    		<p>Sumatran tigers are critically endangered because of deforestation and poaching in 
	    		their home habitat Sumatra. A key contributor to the habitat loss in Sumatra is the 
	    		fast food restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken, whose napkins and food containers are made
	    		from paper derived from clear-cutting of crucial portions of the Sumatran jungle. 
	    		Organizations like the Sumatran Tiger Project, which has been active in the area since
	    		the 1990s, are trying their best to conserve the small tiger population. National parks 
	    		and special conservation areas have been set up in a cooperative project involving the 
	    		Indonesian Forest Ministry and the Australia Zoo. Greenpeace and other organizations are 
	    		fighting the jungle clearing that is going on to supply KFC and other companies with paper. </p>
